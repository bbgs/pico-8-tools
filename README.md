# PICO-8 tools

PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua commands and provides simple built-in tools for creating your own cartridges.

See http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php.

## lua2pico.py

Replace the lua part of an PICO-8 cart. Use this to create lua code in an external editor. Only works on OS X at the moment.

```./lua2pico.py lua-script pico8-cart```
